A short document identifying existing products that solve the same (or similar) problems.

We will be highlighting their features, and contrasting them with that of our product.

## Maple
https://www.growmaple.com/

Maple is an app available on the web and mobile devices that allows for households to collaborate on "Household Topics". 

Each Household Topic (folder) contains the following:
* A shared group chat
* Shared notes (rich text editor)
* Shared to-do lists (with assignment of tasks)

Members of a household can be invited using their phone number and the app has integration with Google Calendar.

Our product uses "Tabs", which are asymmetric and customizable, reducing the clutter of unused features such those that are bundled in each of Maple's Household Topic. 
In addition, we have an inventory system, which has functions that a to-do list isn't designed to deal with. User created tasks are integrated with our inventory system.

## OurHome
http://ourhomeapp.com/

OurHome is an app available on the web and mobile devices primarily aimed towards families with kids. Completing chores and tasks is gameified through their rewards points system, which encourages good behaviour through positive reinforcement.

Features include:
* Task lists (with scheduling and assignment of tasks)
* A shared calendar
* A groceries list

Our product appeals to a wider audience, specifically any persons in a shared living situation. For example, university students may be put off by the features in OurHome that are juvenile in appearance and by design. We believe OurHome decided to market to a narrower demographic with specific needs (families with young children), and in broadening their audience, it would diminish their key features that distinguish them from other competitors.

## Roomiez
https://www.roomiez.ca/

Roomiez is an app available on mobile devices, which aims to assist and simplify the roommate experience. It provides tools for roommates looking to communicate, share household duties, and manage expenses.

Key features:
* Shared bulletin board
* Chores tracker
* Expense tracking and budgeting tools 

Our product has an intuitive loan management system in addition to the expense tracking and budgeting tools of Roomiez, and our chat system allows for one-on-one conversations or group discussions between roommates. Unlike Roomiez, our product has a broad appeal, which includes families, as opposed to Roomiez which has features that are more tailored to rentors sharing a living space. Similarly to OurHome, we believe that Roomiez decided to market to a narrower demographic with specific needs, and that expanding beyond that would diminish their key features that distinguish them from other competitors.
