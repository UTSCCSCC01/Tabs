## Team Organization
- We allowed individuals to volunteer to take on different tasks or roles as they pleased.
- If noone was biased to a task in any way then it was delegated to who the group personally thought was best for the job.


## Decision Making
- We made decisions by offering everyone the chance to give suggestions and give feedback on said suggestions until we could unanimously reach a conclusion.
- Often times we had to go back and rework decisions once we received more knowledge on the issue. This was done smoothly and orderly through the same process.
- Priority of the user stories was decided by coming to a group consensus on what features of the product made it stand out the most.

## Meeting Structure
- Meetings were held daily with all meetings between Saturday and Monday being optional.
- Meeting absence had to be given at least 24 hours in advance with the exception of unpredictable circumstances.
- Each meeting had a designated note taker who followed a format consistent across meetings.
- Great care was taken to ensure each team member was allowed to contribute their opinion to every topic discussed.
- It was also ensured that all team members were on the same page as to avoid confusion.


## Lessons to Take Forward

### We need to improve our communication:
- Meeting frequently is great, but often times problems would only be discussed during meetings which could leave anywhere between 24-72 hours of inefficient work.
- Team members should become more comfortable with texting or communicating in the groupchat outside of meeting times.
### Less talk more action:
- Often times we would exhaust ourselves discussing or theorizing about an idea for far too long. This ironically lead to confusion in the group and the corresponding task not being completed due to the overcomplications.
- This especially posed a problem as regardless of how much theorizing was done, the implementation of the task still had to be refined and reworking still had to be done on the idea.
### Continue to stay on top of deadlines:
- Team members often got unexpectedly sidetracked with other responsibilities, committments and personal events. Fortunately, there was provision for this in the planning and so we never had to "crunch". 
- This will be invaluable in the later sprints when other courses start to ramp up in difficulty.
