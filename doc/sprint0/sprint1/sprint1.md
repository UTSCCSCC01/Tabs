- I as a roommate should be able to view and sort the food inventory by scarcity so that I can know what I should buy at the grocery store
    - Create food inventory main screen in frontend (View)

- I as a roommate should be able to have a section in the inventory for items that I am not willing to share so that other roommates can avoid unknowingly using them

- I as a roommate should be able to modify the inventory so that it accurately represents the quantities of items we all have
