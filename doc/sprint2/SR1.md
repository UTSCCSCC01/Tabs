Sprint 1 Retrospective: 2 things we liked and 2 things we could've done better

Gigi: We had good communication and we were able to get work done. We also need a clearer timeline as well as clearer
expectations of what needs to be done.

JP: We were able to get work out relatively quickly and with a somewhat decent level of organization. We need to focus on 
delegating tasks better.

Crystal: It was good that we split up deliverables as soon as possible and made an attempt to finsih things early, however,
we need better distribution of work and better documentation of subtasks.

Young: The length of the daily meetings were good and we proceeded to take on tasks in a logical order. However, we need to
plan things better instead of in standups.

Tyler: Things went relatively smoothly and efficiently given that this was our first sprint. However, we could've split up
the workload more evenly as well as kept planning for certain tasks outside of standup meetings. 

Klein: It was good that everything was done in advance and that we had relatively short meetings. We need to work on
communicating outside of meetings.
