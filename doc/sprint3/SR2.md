Sprint 2 Retrospective:

Young:
2 things that we should continue doing
  1. Writing documentation for classes and functions
  2. Integrating the different components into the main app
2 things that we should start doing
  1. Better folder organisation in the frontend package
  2. More modularisation in the frontend package
2 things we can do better for next time
  1. Reviewing pull requests better
  2. Using more reusable components

Gigi:
2 things that we should continue doing
    * Gitflow
    * Good communication
2 things that we should start doing
    * Fleshing out pre-existing features
    * Timeline (esp. for blockers)
2 things we can do better for next time
    * Faster planning
    * Reviewing pull requests

Tyler:
2 things that we should continue doing
  - Creating reusable components to allow for quicker development
  - Communicating changes and bugs with one another

2 things that we should start doing
  - Taking demo videos
  - Checking that we have data/users for proper testing and integration

2 things we can do better for next time
  - Making sure that development works (and creating hotfix branches)
  - Ensure that features being presented during the TA demo work

Crystal:
2 things that we should continue doing
  - Communicating progress outside of standup meetings
  - Checking for bugs, render issues on other branches

2 things that we should start doing
  - Testing our pages/components on both iOS and android if possible
  - Better file structure (a little difficult to find/navigate through our frontend folders)

2 things we can do better for next time
  - Get SR and planning meeting out of the way asap ( :c )
  - Double check functionality of all features before due date & demo

Klein:
2 things that we should continue doing
  - Communicating with other teammates outside of meetings
  - Good documentation

2 things that we should start doing
  - Testing our pages/components on both iOS and android if possible
  - Organize a better naming system to avoid confusion

2 things we can do better for next time
  - After every merge to development test every feature to make sure nothing broke
  - Figure out if alternate schema/new queries are needed before taking on task instead of during

JP:
2 things that we should continue doing
  - communication outside of standup meetings
  - writing documentation

2 things that we should start doing
  - implement test cases and talk about initial design a bit more
  - better naming convention and file organization

2 things we can do better for next time
  - create tests before merging, we should implement something on git if there is something for it
  - plan out type defs and schemas by discussing what is needed (backend and frontend)
